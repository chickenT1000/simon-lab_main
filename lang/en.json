    "title": "The Mission",
    "motto": "Code-Native. AI-Ready. Bug-Free.",
    "p1": "The chemical industry is falling behind. While software, finance, and manufacturing have embraced computational workflows, process engineering remains trapped in static documents—PDFs that die on submission, spreadsheets that drift with every revision, drawings that no system can parse.",
    "p2": "This is the Broken Chain. Data created in one phase cannot flow to the next. Every handoff introduces error. Every project starts from scratch.",
    "p3": "We are here to fix it.",
    "p4": "The path forward is Project-as-Code: defining chemical projects in structured, version-controlled formats from the grant phase onward. When the project is code, the mathematics validate themselves. When the project is code, simulations compile from definitions. When the project is code, AI systems can read, check, and assist—not because we've automated engineering, but because we've made engineering computational.",
    "p5": "This isn't about replacing engineers. It's about giving them infrastructure that keeps pace with the tools now available."
  },
  "philosophy": {
    "title": "The Project-as-Code Philosophy",
    "p1": "Traditional chemical projects live in static documents. Grant proposals become PDFs. P&IDs become drawings. Simulations become spreadsheets. Each handoff introduces drift, each revision risks inconsistency, and ultimately—the project's logic dies in formats no system can parse.",
    "p2": "Project-as-Code inverts this paradigm.",
    "p3": "We define project parameters in structured, version-controlled code from the grant phase forward. The mathematics are validated before the first funding request. The process flow compiles into a working simulation before the first line is drawn.",
    "p4": "This isn't AI generating your plant. This is engineering intent captured with sufficient rigor that computational tools can read, validate, and optimize alongside your team.",
    "p5": "The result:",
    "p5_cont": "Projects that are Computational-Ready. Auditable at every revision. Traceable to every decision."
